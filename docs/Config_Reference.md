This document is a reference for options available in the Klipper
config file.

The descriptions in this document are formatted so that it is possible
to cut-and-paste them into a printer config file. See the
[installation document](Installation.md) for information on setting up
Klipper and choosing an initial config file.

# Micro-controller configuration

## Format of micro-controller pin names

Many config options require the name of a micro-controller pin.
Klipper uses the hardware names for these pins - for example `PA4`.

Pin names may be preceded by `!` to indicate that a reverse polarity
should be used (eg, trigger on low instead of high).

Input pins may be preceded by `^` to indicate that a hardware pull-up
resistor should be enabled for the pin. If the micro-controller
supports pull-down resistors then an input pin may alternatively be
preceded by `~`.

Note, some config sections may "create" additional pins. Where this
occurs, the config section defining the pins must be listed in the
config file before any sections using those pins.

## [mcu]

Configuration of the primary micro-controller.

```
[mcu]
serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ.
#   This parameter must be provided when using a serial port.
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
#canbus_uuid:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the unique
#   chip identifier to connect to. This value must be provided when using
#   CAN bus for communication.
#canbus_interface:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the CAN
#   network interface to use. The default is 'can0'.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'cheetah', 'rpi_usb',
#   and 'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on
#   Arduino boards and clones. The 'cheetah' method is a special
#   method needed for some Fysetc Cheetah boards. The 'rpi_usb' method
#   is useful on Raspberry Pi boards with micro-controllers powered
#   over USB - it briefly disables power to all USB ports to
#   accomplish a micro-controller reset. The 'command' method involves
#   sending a Klipper command to the micro-controller so that it can
#   reset itself. The default is 'arduino' if the micro-controller
#   communicates over a serial port, 'command' otherwise.
```

## [mcu my_extra_mcu]

Additional micro-controllers (one may define any number of sections
with an "mcu" prefix). Additional micro-controllers introduce
additional pins that may be configured as heaters, steppers, fans,
etc.. For example, if an "[mcu extra_mcu]" section is introduced, then
pins such as "extra_mcu:ar9" may then be used elsewhere in the config
(where "ar9" is a hardware pin name or alias name on the given mcu).

```
[mcu my_extra_mcu]
# See the "mcu" section for configuration parameters.
```

# Common kinematic settings

## [printer]

The printer section controls high level printer settings.

```
[printer]
kinematics:
#   The type of printer in use. This option may be one of: cartesian,
#   corexy, corexz, hybrid-corexy, hybrid-corexz, rotary_delta, delta,
#   polar, winch, or none. This
#   parameter must be specified.
max_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.
```

## [stepper]

Stepper motor definitions. Different printer types (as specified by
the "kinematics" option in the [printer] config section) require
different names for the stepper (eg, `stepper_x` vs `stepper_a`).
Below are common stepper definitions.

See the [rotation distance document](Rotation_Distance.md) for
information on calculating the `rotation_distance` parameter.

```
[stepper_x]
step_pin:
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin:
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin:
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance:
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.
microsteps:
#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
endstop_pin:
#   Endstop switch detection pin. This parameter must be provided for
#   the X, Y, and Z steppers on cartesian style printers.
#position_min: 0
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to.  The default is 0mm.
position_endstop:
#   Location of the endstop (in mm). This parameter must be provided
#   for the X, Y, and Z steppers on cartesian style printers.
position_max:
#   Maximum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to. This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#homing_speed: 5.0
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when homing. The default
#   is 5mm/s.
#homing_retract_dist: 5.0
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before homing a second time during
#   homing. Set this to zero to disable the second home. The default
#   is 5mm.
#homing_retract_speed:
#   Speed to use on the retract move after homing in case this should
#   be different from the homing speed, which is the default for this
#   parameter
#second_homing_speed:
#   Velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when performing the second home.
#   The default is homing_speed/2.
#homing_positive_dir:
#   If true, homing will cause the stepper to move in a positive
#   direction (away from zero); if false, home towards zero. It is
#   better to use the default than to specify this parameter. The
#   default is true if position_endstop is near position_max and false
#   if near position_min.
```

#   delta_radius for print_radius (which would normally prevent a
#   tower collision).

#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.

available parameters.

CABLE WINCH SUPPORT IS EXPERIMENTAL. Homing is not implemented on
cable winch kinematics. In order to home the printer, manually send
movement commands until the toolhead is at 0,0,0 and then issue a
`G28` command.

```
[printer]
kinematics: winch

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper connected to the first
# cable winch. A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 26 cable winches may be
# defined (stepper_a to stepper_z) though it is common to define 4.
[stepper_a]
rotation_distance:
#   The rotation_distance is the nominal distance (in mm) the toolhead
#   moves towards the cable winch for each full rotation of the
#   stepper motor. This parameter must be provided.
anchor_x:
anchor_y:
anchor_z:
#   The x, y, and z position of the cable winch in cartesian space.
#   These parameters must be provided.

#   The max_velocity and max_accel parameters must be defined. The
#   values are not used for "none" kinematics.
```

# Common extruder and heated bed support

## [extruder]

The extruder section is used to describe both the stepper controlling
the printer extruder and the heater parameters for the nozzle. See the
[pressure advance guide](Pressure_Advance.md) for information on
tuning pressure advance.

```
[extruder]
step_pin:
dir_pin:
enable_pin:
microsteps:
rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for a description of the above parameters.
nozzle_diameter:
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.
filament_diameter:
#   The nominal diameter of the raw filament (in mm) as it enters the
#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#instantaneous_corner_velocity: 1.000
#   The maximum instantaneous velocity change (in mm/s) of the
#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
#max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not have any impact on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040
#   A time range (in seconds) to use when calculating the average
#   extruder velocity for pressure advance. A larger value results in
#   smoother extruder movements. This parameter may not exceed 200ms.
#   This setting only applies if pressure_advance is non-zero. The
#   default is 0.040 (40 milliseconds).
#
# The remaining variables describe the extruder heater.
heater_pin:
#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.
sensor_type:
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "NTC 100K beta 3950", "Honeywell 100K
#   135-104LAG-J01", "NTC 100K MGB18-104F39050L32", "SliceEngineering
#   450", and "TDK NTCG104LH104JT1". See the "Temperature sensors"
#   section for other sensors. This parameter must be provided.
sensor_pin:
#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pullup_resistor: 4700
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the pullup attached to the thermistor.
#   This parameter is only valid when the sensor is a thermistor. The
#   default is 4700 ohms.
#smooth_time: 2.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 2 seconds.
control:
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pid_Kp:
#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
pid_Ki:
#   Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be
#   provided for PID heaters.
pid_Kd:
#   Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#max_delta: 2.0
#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
#min_extrude_temp: 170
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp:
max_temp:
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.
```

## [heater_bed]

The heater_bed section describes a heated bed. It uses the same heater
settings described in the "extruder" section.

```
[heater_bed]
heater_pin:
sensor_type:
sensor_pin:
control:
min_temp:
max_temp:
#   See the "extruder" section for a description of the above parameters.
```

# Bed level support

## [bed_mesh]

Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a bed_mesh config section to enable
move transformations that offset the z axis based on a mesh generated
from probed points. When using a probe to home the z-axis, it is
recommended to define a safe_z_home section in printer.cfg to home
toward the center of the print area.

See the [bed mesh guide](Bed_Mesh.md) and
[command reference](G-Codes.md#mesh-bed-leveling) for additional
information.

Visual Examples:
```
 rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
             x---x---x (max_point)
             |
             x---x---x
                     |
 (min_point) x---x---x

 round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
                x (0,r) end
              /
            x---x---x
                      \
 (-r,0) x---x---x---x---x (r,0)
          \
            x---x---x
                  /
                x  (0,-r) start
```

```
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center x,y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0,0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
#mesh_min:
#   Defines the minimum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max:
#   Defines the maximum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
```

## [bed_tilt]

Bed tilt compensation. One may define a bed_tilt config section to
enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed. Note that
bed_mesh and bed_tilt are incompatible; both cannot be defined.

See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#bed-tilt) for additional
information.

```
[bed_tilt]

#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0,0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that may be used to calibrate appropriate x and y
# adjustment parameters.
#points:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE
#   command. Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe
#   is above the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. The default is
#   to not enable the command.

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
```

## [bed_screws]

Tool to help adjust bed leveling screws. One may define a [bed_screws]
config section to enable a BED_SCREWS_ADJUST g-code command.

See the
[leveling guide](Manual_Level.md#adjusting-bed-leveling-screws) and
[command reference](G-Codes.md#bed-screws-helper) for additional
information.

```
[bed_screws]
#screw1:
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This parameter must be provided.
#screw1_name:
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.
#screw1_fine_adjust:

#screw2_fine_adjust:
#...
#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least three screws must be
#   defined.
#horizontal_move_z: 5

#   expansion of bed and nozzle. The default is zero.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#probe_speed: 5
#   The speed (in mm/s) when moving from a horizontal_move_z position
#   to a probe_height position. The default is 5.
```

## [screws_tilt_adjust]

Tool to help adjust bed screws tilt using Z probe. One may define a
screws_tilt_adjust config section to enable a SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE
g-code command.

See the
[leveling guide](Manual_Level.md#adjusting-bed-leveling-screws-using-the-bed-probe)
and [command reference](G-Codes.md#bed-screws-tilt-adjust-helper) for
additional information.

```
[screws_tilt_adjust]
#screw1:
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This is the base screw used in calculations. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#screw1_name:

```

## [z_tilt]

Multiple Z stepper tilt adjustment. This feature enables independent
adjustment of multiple z steppers (see the "stepper_z1" section) to
adjust for tilt. If this section is present then a Z_TILT_ADJUST
extended [G-Code command](G-Codes.md#z-tilt) becomes available.

```
[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
```

## [quad_gantry_level]

Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors.
Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry
which is more flexible.
WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results.
If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code
command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z motor
configuration:
```
 ----------------
 |Z1          Z2|
 |  ---------   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  x--------   |
 |Z           Z3|
 ----------------
```
Where x is the (0,0) point on the bed

```
[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X,Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X,Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance.
```

## [skew_correction]

Printer Skew Correction. It is possible to use software to correct
printer skew across 3 planes, xy, xz, yz. This is done by printing a
calibration model along a plane and measuring three lengths. Due to
the nature of skew correction these lengths are set via gcode. See
[skew correction](skew_correction.md) and
[command reference](G-Codes.md#skew-correction) for details.

```
[skew_correction]
```

# Customized homing

## [safe_z_home]

Safe Z homing. One may use this mechanism to home the Z axis at a
specific XY coordinate. This is useful if the toolhead, for example
has to move to the center of the bed before Z can be homed.

```
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position:
#   A X,Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop:
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 20.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 20mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, xy are reset to their previous positions after z
#   homing. The default is False.
```

## [homing_override]

Homing override. One may use this mechanism to run a series of g-code
commands in place of a G28 found in the normal g-code input. This may
be useful on printers that require a specific procedure to home the
machine.

```
[homing_override]
gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of G28 commands
#   found in the normal g-code input. See docs/Command_Templates.md
#   for G-Code format. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands
#   then it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer.
#   The commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.
```

## [endstop_phase]

Stepper phase adjusted endstops. To use this feature, define a config
section with an "endstop_phase" prefix followed by the name of the
corresponding stepper config section (for example,
"[endstop_phase stepper_z]"). This feature can improve the accuracy of
endstop switches. Add a bare "[endstop_phase]" declaration to enable
the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.

See the [endstop phases guide](Endstop_Phase.md) and
[command reference](G-Codes.md#endstop-adjustments-by-stepper-phase)
for additional information.

```
[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation.
#trigger_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. It is composed of two numbers separated
#   by a forward slash character - the phase and the total number of
#   phases (eg, "7/64"). Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.
```

# G-Code macros and events

## [gcode_macro]

G-Code macros (one may define any number of sections with a
"gcode_macro" prefix). See the
[command template guide](Command_Templates.md) for more information.

```
[gcode_macro my_cmd]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of "my_cmd". See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#variable_<name>:
#   One may specify any number of options with a "variable_" prefix.
#   The given variable name will be assigned the given value (parsed
#   as a Python literal) and will be available during macro expansion.
#   For example, a config with "variable_fan_speed = 75" might have
#   gcode commands containing "M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }". Variables
#   can be changed at run-time using the SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command
#   (see docs/Command_Templates.md for details). Variable names may
#   not use upper case characters.
#rename_existing:
#   This option will cause the macro to override an existing G-Code
#   command and provide the previous definition of the command via the
#   name provided here. This can be used to override builtin G-Code
#   commands. Care should be taken when overriding commands as it can
#   cause complex and unexpected results. The default is to not
#   override an existing G-Code command.
#description: G-Code macro
#   This will add a short description used at the HELP command or while
#   using the auto completion feature. Default "G-Code macro"
```

## [delayed_gcode]

Execute a gcode on a set delay. See the
[command template guide](Command_Templates.md#delayed-gcodes) and
[command reference](G-Codes.md#delayed-gcode) for more information.

```
[delayed_gcode my_delayed_gcode]
gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when the delay duration has
#   elapsed. G-Code templates are supported. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#initial_duration: 0.0
#   The duration of the initial delay (in seconds). If set to a
#   non-zero value the delayed_gcode will execute the specified number
#   of seconds after the printer enters the "ready" state. This can be
#   useful for initialization procedures or a repeating delayed_gcode.
#   If set to 0 the delayed_gcode will not execute on startup.
#   Default is 0.
```

## [save_variables]

Support saving variables to disk so that they are retained across
restarts. See
[command templates](Command_Templates.md#save-variables-to-disk) and
[G-Code reference](G-Codes.md#save-variables) for further information.

```
[save_variables]
filename:
#   Required - provide a filename that would be used to save the
#   variables to disk e.g. ~/variables.cfg
```

## [idle_timeout]

Idle timeout. An idle timeout is automatically enabled - add an
explicit idle_timeout config section to change the default settings.

```
[idle_timeout]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute on an idle timeout. See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The default is to run
#   "TURN_OFF_HEATERS" and "M84".
#timeout: 600
#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.
```

# Optional G-Code features

## [virtual_sdcard]

A virtual sdcard may be useful if the host machine is not fast enough
to run OctoPrint well. It allows the Klipper host software to directly
print gcode files stored in a directory on the host using standard
sdcard G-Code commands (eg, M24).

```
[virtual_sdcard]
path:
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
#   be provided.
```

## [sdcard_loop]

Some printers with stage-clearing features, such as a part ejector or
a belt printer, can find use in looping sections of the sdcard file.
(For example, to print the same part over and over, or repeat the
a section of a part for a chain or other repeated pattern).

See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#sdcard-loop) for supported
commands. See the [sample-macros.cfg](../config/sample-macros.cfg)
file for a Marlin compatible M808 G-Code macro.

```
[sdcard_loop]
```

## [force_move]

Support manually moving stepper motors for diagnostic purposes. Note,
using this feature may place the printer in an invalid state - see the
[command reference](G-Codes.md#force-movement) for important details.

```
[force_move]
#enable_force_move: False
#   Set to true to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION
#   extended G-Code commands. The default is false.
```

## [pause_resume]

Pause/Resume functionality with support of position capture and
restore. See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#pause-resume) for more
information.

```
[pause_resume]
#recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s). Default is 50.0 mm/s.
```

## [firmware_retraction]

Firmware filament retraction. This enables G10 (retract) and G11
(unretract) GCODE commands issued by many slicers. The parameters
below provide startup defaults, although the values can be adjusted
via the SET_RETRACTION [command](G-Codes.md#firmware-retraction)),
allowing per-filament settings and runtime tuning.

```
[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
#retract_speed: 20
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
#unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.
```

## [gcode_arcs]

Support for gcode arc (G2/G3) commands.

```
[gcode_arcs]
#resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a
#   finer arc, but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than
#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.
```

## [respond]

Enable the "M118" and "RESPOND" extended
[commands](G-Codes.md#send-message-respond-to-host).

```
[respond]
#default_type: echo
#   Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one
#   of the following:
#       echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#       command: "// "
#       error: "!! "
#default_prefix: echo:
#   Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will
#   override the "default_type".
```

# Resonance compensation

## [input_shaper]

Enables [resonance compensation](Resonance_Compensation.md). Also see
the [command reference](G-Codes.md#resonance-compensation).

```
[input_shaper]
#shaper_freq_x: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for X axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of X axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for X axis.
#shaper_freq_y: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for Y axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of Y axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for Y axis.
#shaper_type: mzv
#   A type of the input shaper to use for both X and Y axes. Supported
#   shapers are zv, mzv, zvd, ei, 2hump_ei, and 3hump_ei. The default
#   is mzv input shaper.
#shaper_type_x:
#shaper_type_y:
#   If shaper_type is not set, these two parameters can be used to
#   configure different input shapers for X and Y axes. The same
#   values are supported as for shaper_type parameter.
#damping_ratio_x: 0.1
#damping_ratio_y: 0.1
#   Damping ratios of vibrations of X and Y axes used by input shapers
#   to improve vibration suppression. Default value is 0.1 which is a
#   good all-round value for most printers. In most circumstances this
#   parameter requires no tuning and should not be changed.
```

## [adxl345]

Support for ADXL345 accelerometers. This support allows one to query
accelerometer measurements from the sensor. This enables an
ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE command (see
[G-Codes](G-Codes.md#adxl345-accelerometer-commands) for more
information). The default chip name is "default", but one may specify
an explicit name (eg, [adxl345 my_chip_name]).

```
[adxl345]
cs_pin:
#   The SPI enable pin for the sensor. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed: 5000000
#   The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.
#   The default is 5000000.
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#axes_map: x,y,z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's x, y, and z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y,x,z" to swap the x and y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x,z,-y"). The default is "x,y,z".
#rate: 3200
#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.
```

## [resonance_tester]

Support for resonance testing and automatic input shaper calibration.
In order to use most of the functionality of this module, additional
software dependencies must be installed; refer to
[Measuring Resonances](Measuring_Resonances.md) and the
[command reference](G-Codes.md#resonance-testing-commands) for more
information. See the [Max smoothing](Measuring_Resonances.md#max-smoothing)
section of the measuring resonances guide for more information on
`max_smoothing` parameter and its use.

```
[resonance_tester]
#probe_points:
#   A list of X,Y,Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
#accel_chip:
#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
#accel_chip_x:
#accel_chip_y:
#   Names of the accelerometer chips to use for measurements for each
#   of the axis. Can be useful, for instance, on bed slinger printer,
#   if two separate accelerometers are mounted on the bed (for Y axis)
#   and on the toolhead (for X axis). These parameters have the same
#   format as 'accel_chip' parameter. Only 'accel_chip' or these two
#   parameters must be provided.
#max_smoothing:
#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
#   maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
#   for more details on using this feature.
#min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
#max_freq: 120
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 120 Hz.
#accel_per_hz: 75
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
```

# Config file helpers

## [board_pins]

Board pin aliases (one may define any number of sections with a
"board_pins" prefix). Use this to define aliases for the pins on a
micro-controller.

```
[board_pins my_aliases]
mcu: mcu
#   A comma separated list of micro-controllers that may use the
#   aliases. The default is to apply the aliases to the main "mcu".
aliases:
aliases_<name>:
#   A comma separated list of "name=value" aliases to create for the
#   given micro-controller. For example, "EXP1_1=PE6" would create an
#   "EXP1_1" alias for the "PE6" pin. However, if "value" is enclosed
#   in "<>" then "name" is created as a reserved pin (for example,
#   "EXP1_9=<GND>" would reserve "EXP1_9"). Any number of options
#   starting with "aliases_" may be specified.
```

## [include]

Include file support. One may include additional config file from the
main printer config file. Wildcards may also be used (eg,
"configs/*.cfg").

```
[include my_other_config.cfg]
```

## [duplicate_pin_override]

This tool allows a single micro-controller pin to be defined multiple
times in a config file without normal error checking. This is intended
for diagnostic and debugging purposes. This section is not needed
where Klipper supports using the same pin multiple times, and using
this override may cause confusing and unexpected results.

```
[duplicate_pin_override]
pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins that may be used multiple times in
#   a config file without normal error checks. This parameter must be
#   provided.
```

# Bed probing hardware

## [probe]

Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height probing
hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and QUERY_PROBE extended
[g-code commands](G-Codes.md#probe) become available. Also, see the
[probe calibrate guide](Probe_Calibrate.md). The probe section also
creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One may set the
stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian style printers
that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
"probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in the
stepper_z config section.

```
[probe]
pin:
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
#deactivate_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should execute deactivation gcode
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. The default is True.
#x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#y_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset:
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 0
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.
```

## [bltouch]

BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
section) to enable a BLTouch probe. See [BL-Touch guide](BLTouch.md)
and [command reference](G-Codes.md#bltouch) for further information. A
virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
section for the details).

```
[bltouch]
sensor_pin:
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. Most BLTouch devices
#   require a pullup on the sensor pin (prefix the pin name with "^").
#   This parameter must be provided.
control_pin:
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pin_move_time: 0.680
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.680 seconds.
#stow_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
#   this to False. The default is True.
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
#x_offset:
#y_offset:
#z_offset:
#speed:
#samples:
#sample_retract_dist:
#samples_result:
#samples_tolerance:
#samples_tolerance_retries:
#   See the "probe" section for information on these parameters.
```

# Additional stepper motors and extruders

## [stepper_z1]

Multi-stepper axes. On a cartesian style printer, the stepper
controlling a given axis may have additional config blocks defining
steppers that should be stepped in concert with the primary stepper.
One may define any number of sections with a numeric suffix starting
at 1 (for example, "stepper_z1", "stepper_z2", etc.).

```
[stepper_z1]
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above parameters.
#endstop_pin:
#   If an endstop_pin is defined for the additional stepper then the
#   stepper will home until the endstop is triggered. Otherwise, the
#   stepper will home until the endstop on the primary stepper for the
#   axis is triggered.
```

## [extruder1]

In a multi-extruder printer add an additional extruder section for
each additional extruder. The additional extruder sections should be
named "extruder1", "extruder2", "extruder3", and so on. See the
"extruder" section for a description of available parameters.

See [sample-multi-extruder.cfg](../config/sample-multi-extruder.cfg)
for an example configuration.

```
[extruder1]
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#...
#   See the "extruder" section for available stepper and heater
#   parameters.
#shared_heater:
#   If this extruder uses the same heater already defined for another
#   extruder then place the name of that extruder here. For example,
#   should extruder3 and extruder4 share a heater then the extruder3
#   config section should define the heater and the extruder4 section
#   should specify "shared_heater: extruder3". The default is to not
#   reuse an existing heater.
```

## [dual_carriage]

Support for cartesian printers with dual carriages on a single
axis. The active carriage is set via the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE extended
g-code command. The "SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE CARRIAGE=1" command will
activate the carriage defined in this section (CARRIAGE=0 will return
activation to the primary carriage). Dual carriage support is
typically combined with extra extruders - the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE
command is often called at the same time as the ACTIVATE_EXTRUDER
command. Be sure to park the carriages during deactivation.

See [sample-idex.cfg](../config/sample-idex.cfg) for an example
configuration.

```
[dual_carriage]
axis:
#   The axis this extra carriage is on (either x or y). This parameter
#   must be provided.
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#endstop_pin:
#position_endstop:
#position_min:
#position_max:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above parameters.
```

## [extruder_stepper]

Support for additional steppers synchronized to the movement of an
extruder (one may define any number of sections with an
"extruder_stepper" prefix).

See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#extruder-stepper-commands) for
more information.

```
[extruder_stepper my_extra_stepper]
#extruder: extruder
#   The extruder this stepper is synchronized to. The default is
#   "extruder".
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
```

## [manual_stepper]

Manual steppers (one may define any number of sections with a
"manual_stepper" prefix). These are steppers that are controlled by
the MANUAL_STEPPER g-code command. For example: "MANUAL_STEPPER
STEPPER=my_stepper MOVE=10 SPEED=5". See
[G-Codes](G-Codes.md#manual-stepper-commands) file for a description
of the MANUAL_STEPPER command. The steppers are not connected to the
normal printer kinematics.

```
[manual_stepper my_stepper]
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for a description of these parameters.
#velocity:
#   Set the default velocity (in mm/s) for the stepper. This value
#   will be used if a MANUAL_STEPPER command does not specify a SPEED
#   parameter. The default is 5mm/s.
#accel:
#   Set the default acceleration (in mm/s^2) for the stepper. An
#   acceleration of zero will result in no acceleration. This value
#   will be used if a MANUAL_STEPPER command does not specify an ACCEL
#   parameter. The default is zero.
#endstop_pin:
#   Endstop switch detection pin. If specified, then one may perform
#   "homing moves" by adding a STOP_ON_ENDSTOP parameter to
#   MANUAL_STEPPER movement commands.
```

# Custom heaters and sensors

## [verify_heater]

Heater and temperature sensor verification. Heater verification is
automatically enabled for each heater that is configured on the
printer. Use verify_heater sections to change the default settings.

```
[verify_heater heater_config_name]
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
#check_gain_time:
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.
```

## [homing_heaters]

Tool to disable heaters when homing or probing an axis.

```
[homing_heaters]
#steppers:
#   A comma separated list of steppers that should cause heaters to be
#   disabled. The default is to disable heaters for any homing/probing
#   move.
#   Typical example: stepper_z
#heaters:
#   A comma separated list of heaters to disable during homing/probing
#   moves. The default is to disable all heaters.
#   Typical example: extruder, heater_bed
```

## [thermistor]

Custom thermistors (one may define any number of sections with a
"thermistor" prefix). A custom thermistor may be used in the
sensor_type field of a heater config section. (For example, if one
defines a "[thermistor my_thermistor]" section then one may use a
"sensor_type: my_thermistor" when defining a heater.) Be sure to place
the thermistor section in the config file above its first use in a
heater section.

```
[thermistor my_thermistor]
#temperature1:
#resistance1:
#temperature2:
#resistance2:
#temperature3:
#resistance3:
#   Three resistance measurements (in Ohms) at the given temperatures
#   (in Celsius). The three measurements will be used to calculate the
#   Steinhart-Hart coefficients for the thermistor. These parameters
#   must be provided when using Steinhart-Hart to define the
#   thermistor.
#beta:
#   Alternatively, one may define temperature1, resistance1, and beta
#   to define the thermistor parameters. This parameter must be
#   provided when using "beta" to define the thermistor.
```

## [adc_temperature]

Custom ADC temperature sensors (one may define any number of sections
with an "adc_temperature" prefix). This allows one to define a custom
temperature sensor that measures a voltage on an Analog to Digital
Converter (ADC) pin and uses linear interpolation between a set of
configured temperature/voltage (or temperature/resistance)
measurements to determine the temperature. The resulting sensor can be
used as a sensor_type in a heater section. (For example, if one
defines a "[adc_temperature my_sensor]" section then one may use a
"sensor_type: my_sensor" when defining a heater.) Be sure to place the
sensor section in the config file above its first use in a heater
section.

```
[adc_temperature my_sensor]
#temperature1:
#voltage1:
#temperature2:
#voltage2:
#...
#   A set of temperatures (in Celsius) and voltages (in Volts) to use
#   as reference when converting a temperature. A heater section using
#   this sensor may also specify adc_voltage and voltage_offset
#   parameters to define the ADC voltage (see "Common temperature
#   amplifiers" section for details). At least two measurements must
#   be provided.
#temperature1:
#resistance1:
#temperature2:
#resistance2:
#...
#   Alternatively one may specify a set of temperatures (in Celsius)
#   and resistance (in Ohms) to use as reference when converting a
#   temperature. A heater section using this sensor may also specify a
#   pullup_resistor parameter (see "extruder" section for details). At
#   least two measurements must be provided.
```

## [heater_generic]

Generic heaters (one may define any number of sections with a
"heater_generic" prefix). These heaters behave similarly to standard
heaters (extruders, heated beds). Use the SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE
command (see [G-Codes](G-Codes.md) for details) to set the target
temperature.

```
[heater_generic my_generic_heater]
#gcode_id:
#   The id to use when reporting the temperature in the M105 command.
#   This parameter must be provided.
#heater_pin:
#max_power:
#sensor_type:
#sensor_pin:
#smooth_time:
#control:
#pid_Kp:
#pid_Ki:
#pid_Kd:
#pwm_cycle_time:
#min_temp:
#max_temp:
#   See the "extruder" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
```

## [temperature_sensor]

Generic temperature sensors. One can define any number of additional
temperature sensors that are reported via the M105 command.

```
[temperature_sensor my_sensor]
#sensor_type:
#sensor_pin:
#min_temp:
#max_temp:
#   See the "extruder" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
#gcode_id:
#   See the "heater_generic" section for the definition of this
#   parameter.
```

# Temperature sensors

Klipper includes definitions for many types of temperature sensors.
These sensors may be used in any config section that requires a
temperature sensor (such as an `[extruder]` or `[heated_bed]`
section).

## Common thermistors

Common thermistors. The following parameters are available in heater
sections that use one of these sensors.

```
sensor_type:

#sensor_temperature1:
#sensor_adc1:
#   Specify the above two parameters (a temperature in Celsius and an
#   ADC value as a float between 0.0 and 1.0) to calibrate the
#   micro-controller temperature. This may improve the reported
#   temperature accuracy on some chips. A typical way to obtain this
#   calibration information is to completely remove power from the
#   printer for a few hours (to ensure it is at the ambient
#   temperature), then power it up and use the QUERY_ADC command to
#   obtain an ADC measurement. Use some other temperature sensor on
#   the printer to find the corresponding ambient temperature. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.
#sensor_temperature2:
#sensor_adc2:
#   If sensor_temperature1/sensor_adc1 is specified then one may also
#   specify sensor_temperature2/sensor_adc2 calibration data. Doing so
#   may provide calibrated "temperature slope" information. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the

DS18B20 sensors are only supported on the "host mcu", e.g. the Raspberry Pi. The w1-gpio Linux kernel module must be installed.

```
sensor_type: DS18B20
serial_no:
#   Each 1-wire device has a unique serial number used to identify the device,
#   usually in the format 28-031674b175ff. This parameter must be provided.

#   Interval in seconds between readings. Default is 3.0, with a minimum of 1.0
#sensor_mcu:
#   The micro-controller to read from. Must be the host_mcu
```

# Fans

## [fan]

Print cooling fan.

```
[fan]
pin:
#   Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#kick_start_time: 0.100
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first
#   enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
#   spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#off_below: 0.0
#   The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a
#   value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
#   requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be
#   used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
#   effective. The default is 0.0.
#
#   This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted.
#   To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
#   fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest
#   input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
#   off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for
#   example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
#tachometer_pin:
#   Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally
#   required. This parameter is optional.
#tachometer_ppr: 2
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per
#   revolution of the tachometer signal. For a BLDC fan this is
#   normally half the number of poles. The default is 2.
#tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0015
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the
#   tachometer pin, in seconds. The default is 0.0015, which is fast
#   enough for fans below 10000 RPM at 2 PPR. This must be smaller than
#   30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the
#   maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.
```

## [heater_fan]

#heater:
#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with. If a comma separated list of heater names is

[g-code commands](G-Codes.md#custom-pin-commands).

```
[output_pin my_pin]
pin:
#   The pin to configure as an output. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pwm: False
#   Set if the output pin should be capable of pulse-width-modulation.
#   If this is true, the value fields should be between 0 and 1; if it
#   is false the value fields should be either 0 or 1. The default is
#   False.
#static_value:
#   If this is set, then the pin is assigned to this value at startup
#   and the pin can not be changed during runtime. A static pin uses
#   slightly less ram in the micro-controller. The default is to use
#   runtime configuration of pins.
#value:
#   The value to initially set the pin to during MCU configuration.
#   The default is 0 (for low voltage).
#shutdown_value:
#   The value to set the pin to on an MCU shutdown event. The default
#   is 0 (for low voltage).
#maximum_mcu_duration:
#   The maximum duration a non-shutdown value may be driven by the MCU
#   without an acknowledge from the host.
#   If host can not keep up with an update, the MCU will shutdown

#   using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is constrained by the
#   implementation and may be significantly different than the
#   requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.
```

## [static_digital_output]

Statically configured digital output pins (one may define any number
of sections with a "static_digital_output" prefix). Pins configured
here will be setup as a GPIO output during MCU configuration. They can
not be changed at run-time.

```
[static_digital_output my_output_pins]
pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins to be set as GPIO output pins. The

#   with "!". This parameter must be provided.
```

## [multi_pin]

Multiple pin outputs (one may define any number of sections with a
"multi_pin" prefix). A multi_pin output creates an internal pin alias
that can modify multiple output pins each time the alias pin is
set. For example, one could define a "[multi_pin my_fan]" object
containing two pins and then set "pin=multi_pin:my_fan" in the "[fan]"
section - on each fan change both output pins would be updated. These
aliases may not be used with stepper motor pins.

```

#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#chain_position:
#chain_length:
#   These parameters configure an SPI daisy chain. The two parameters
#   define the stepper position in the chain and the total chain length.
#   Position 1 corresponds to the stepper that connects to the MOSI signal.
#   The default is to not use an SPI daisy chain.
#interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). The default is True.

#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
#hold_current:

#diag0_pin:
#diag1_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to one of the DIAG lines of the
#   TMC2130 chip. Only a single diag pin should be specified. The pin
#   is "active low" and is thus normally prefaced with "^!". Setting
#   this creates a "tmc2130_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual pin

#   Setting this creates a "tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual
#   pin which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this
#   enables "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGTHRS to
#   an appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
```

## [tmc2660]

Configure a TMC2660 stepper motor driver via SPI bus. To use this
feature, define a config section with a tmc2660 prefix followed by the

#idle_current_percent: 100
#   The percentage of the run_current the stepper driver will be
#   lowered to when the idle timeout expires (you need to set up the
#   timeout using a [idle_timeout] config section). The current will
#   be raised again once the stepper has to move again. Make sure to
#   set this to a high enough value such that the steppers do not lose
#   their position. There is also small delay until the current is
#   raised again, so take this into account when commanding fast moves
#   while the stepper is idling. The default is 100 (no reduction).

## [display_data]

Support for displaying custom data on an lcd screen. One may create
any number of display groups and any number of data items under those
groups. The display will show all the data items for a given group if
the display_group option in the [display] section is set to the given
group name.

A
[default set of display groups](../klippy/extras/display/display.cfg)
are automatically created. One can replace or extend these
display_data items by overriding the defaults in the main printer.cfg
config file.

```
[display_data my_group_name my_data_name]
position:
#   Comma separated row and column of the display position that should
#   be used to display the information. This parameter must be
#   provided.
text:
#   The text to show at the given position. This field is evaluated
#   using command templates (see docs/Command_Templates.md). This
#   parameter must be provided.
```

## [display_template]

Display data text "macros" (one may define any number of sections with
a display_template prefix). This feature allows one to reduce
repetitive definitions in display_data sections. One may use the
builtin render() function in display_data sections to evaluate a
template. For example, if one were to define `[display_template
my_template]` then one could use `{ render('my_template') }` in a
display_data section.

```
[display_template my_template_name]
#param_<name>:
#   One may specify any number of options with a "param_" prefix. The
#   given name will be assigned the given value (parsed as a Python
#   literal) and will be available during macro expansion. If the
#   parameter is passed in the call to render() then that value will
#   be used during macro expansion. For example, a config with
#   "param_speed = 75" might have a caller with
#   "render('my_template_name', param_speed=80)". Parameter names may
#   not use upper case characters.
#text:
#   The text to return when the render() function is called for this
#   template. This field is evaluated using command templates (see
#   docs/Command_Templates.md). This parameter must be provided.
```

## [display_glyph]

Display a custom glyph on displays that support it. The given name
will be assigned the given display data which can then be referenced
in the display templates by their name surrounded by two "tilde"
symbols i.e. `~my_display_glyph~`

See [sample-glyphs.cfg](../config/sample-glyphs.cfg) for some
examples.

```
[display_glyph my_display_glyph]
#data:
#   The display data, stored as 16 lines consisting of 16 bits (1 per
#   pixel) where '.' is a blank pixel and '*' is an on pixel (e.g.,
#   "****************" to display a solid horizontal line).
#   Alternatively, one can use '0' for a blank pixel and '1' for an on
#   pixel. Put each display line into a separate config line. The
#   glyph must consist of exactly 16 lines with 16 bits each. This
#   parameter is optional.
#hd44780_data:
#   Glyph to use on 20x4 hd44780 displays. The glyph must consist of
#   exactly 8 lines with 5 bits each. This parameter is optional.
#hd44780_slot:
#   The hd44780 hardware index (0..7) to store the glyph at. If
#   multiple distinct images use the same slot then make sure to only
#   use one of those images in any given screen. This parameter is
#   required if hd44780_data is specified.
```

## [display my_extra_display]

If a primary [display] section has been defined in printer.cfg as
shown above it is possible to define multiple auxiliary displays. Note
that auxiliary displays do not currently support menu functionality,
thus they do not support the "menu" options or button configuration.

```
[display my_extra_display]
# See the "display" section for available parameters.
```

## [menu]

Customizable lcd display menus.

A [default set of menus](../klippy/extras/display/menu.cfg) are
automatically created. One can replace or extend the menu by
overriding the defaults in the main printer.cfg config file.

See the
[command template document](Command_Templates.md#menu-templates) for
information on menu attributes available during template rendering.

```
# Common parameters available for all menu config sections.
#[menu __some_list __some_name]
#type: disabled
#   Permanently disabled menu element, only required attribute is 'type'.
#   Allows you to easily disable/hide existing menu items.

#       list    - it allows for menu items to be grouped together in a
#                 scrollable list.  Add to the list by creating menu
#                 configurations using "some_list" as a prefix - for
#                 example: [menu some_list some_item_in_the_list]
#       vsdlist - same as 'list' but will append files from virtual sdcard

# Board specific hardware support

## [sx1509]

Configure an SX1509 I2C to GPIO expander. Due to the delay incurred by
I2C communication you should NOT use SX1509 pins as stepper enable,
step or dir pins or any other pin that requires fast bit-banging. They
are best used as static or gcode controlled digital outputs or
hardware-pwm pins for e.g. fans. One may define any number of sections
with an "sx1509" prefix. Each expander provides a set of 16 pins
(sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_0 to sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_15) which can be used
in the printer configuration.

See the [generic-duet2-duex.cfg](../config/generic-duet2-duex.cfg)
file for an example.

```
[sx1509 my_sx1509]
i2c_address:
#   I2C address used by this expander. Depending on the hardware
#   jumpers this is one out of the following addresses: 62 63 112
#   113. This parameter must be provided.
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:
#i2c_speed:
#   See the "common I2C settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#i2c_bus:
#   If the I2C implementation of your micro-controller supports
#   multiple I2C busses, you may specify the bus name here. The
#   default is to use the default micro-controller i2c bus.
```

## [samd_sercom]

SAMD SERCOM configuration to specify which pins to use on a given
SERCOM. One may define any number of sections with a "samd_sercom"
prefix. Each SERCOM must be configured prior to using it as SPI or I2C
peripheral. Place this config section above any other section that
makes use of SPI or I2C buses.

```
[samd_sercom my_sercom]
sercom:
#   The name of the sercom bus to configure in the micro-controller.
#   Available names are "sercom0", "sercom1", etc.. This parameter
#   must be provided.

#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.
#rx_pin:
#   MISO pin for SPI communication. This pin is not used for I2C
#   communication (I2C uses tx_pin for both sending and receiving).
#   The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration for the given
#   SERCOM peripheral. This parameter is optional.
clk_pin:
#   CLK pin for SPI communication, or SCL (clock) pin for I2C
#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.
```

## [adc_scaled]

Duet2 Maestro analog scaling by vref and vssa readings. Defining an
adc_scaled section enables virtual adc pins (such as "my_name:PB0")
that are automatically adjusted by the board's vref and vssa
monitoring pins. Be sure to define this config section above any
config sections that use one these virtual pins.

See the
[generic-duet2-maestro.cfg](../config/generic-duet2-maestro.cfg) file
for an example.

```
[adc_scaled my_name]
vref_pin:
#   The ADC pin to use for VREF monitoring. This parameter must be
#   provided.
vssa_pin:
#   The ADC pin to use for VSSA monitoring. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#smooth_time: 2.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which the vref and vssa
#   measurements will be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement
#   noise. The default is 2 seconds.

# Other Custom Modules

## [palette2]

Palette 2 multimaterial support - provides a tighter integration
supporting Palette 2 devices in connected mode.

This modules also requires `[virtual_sdcard]` and `[pause_resume]`
for full functionality.

If you use this module, do not use the Palette 2 plugin for
Octoprint as they will conflict, and 1 will fail to initialize
properly likely aborting your print.

If you use Octoprint and stream gcode over the serial port instead of
printing from virtual_sd, then remo **M1** and **M0** from *Pausing commands*
in *Settings > Serial Connection > Firmware & protocol* will prevent
the need to start print on the Palette 2 and unpausing in Octoprint
for your print to begin.

```
[palette2]
serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the Palette 2.
#baud: 115200
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 115200.

#feedrate_normal: 1.0
#   The feedrate to use after splicing, default is 1.0
#auto_load_speed: 2
#   Extrude feedrate when autoloading, default is 2 (mm/s)
#auto_cancel_variation: 0.1
#   Auto cancel print when ping varation is above this threshold
```
